## Introduction

What explains the the form of the contract for newly patented innovations?

1. The superiority of a licensor's precontractual information about the economic value of the innovation
2. Sharing this information with the licensee may facilitate imitation

## The problem of innovation transfer

## Exclusive contracts

## Nonexclusive contracts for product or drastic innovations

## The separating equilibrium contracts

## Conclusions

## Critique

The paper was published 28 years ago. 
* No continious types, only A and B
* Many assumptions are too strong
